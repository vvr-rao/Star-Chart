# Star-Chart

Work in Progress code. Using this to analyze Astronomy data.
Data source is from the HYG Database and is available here:https://www.astronexus.com/hyg AND https://github.com/astronexus

The source dataset combines data from the Hipparcos Catalog, Yale Bright Star Catalog & Gliese Catalog. (I DO NOT own the dataset - refer links above for the original source) 

Planning to use the data for querying of data sructures using AWS Glue and Neo4j
